An urge to cook something special is too hard to resist sometimes. But what if you lost the recipe? Or your beloved grandma is too busy to answer a call and remind you of your favorite cake recipe? Here is a program that stores all recipes in one place. It's a multi-user web service with Spring Boot that allows storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting recipes.

**Stage 1/5: First recipe**

Implement a simple JSON API that supports adding and retrieving a recipe.

**Stage 2/5: Multiple recipes**

Improve the web service to support multiple recipes.

**Stage 3/5: Store a recipe**

Add a database to store and delete recipes.

**Stage 4/5: Sort & update**

Retrieve recipes by their category/name and update them if you need to.

**Stage 5/5: More chefs to table**

Improve the service to support registration and multiple users.
